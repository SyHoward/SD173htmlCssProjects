    <p>Learn when to stop. Put it in, leave it alone. We'll put a happy little sky in here.

        Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Water's like me. It's laaazy... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Just make little strokes like that. Use your imagination, let it go.
        
        Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.
        
        Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Anyone can paint. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Here's another little happy bush You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.
        
        This is gonna be a happy little seascape. It all happens automatically. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
        
        Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. There comes a nice little fluffer. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.

    <h2>Div Two</h2>
    <p>Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. You can create anything that makes you happy.

        We can fix anything. That's crazy. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.
        
        There we are. Let your heart be your guide. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this.
        
        From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.
        
        Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Let all these things just sort of happen.

    <h2>Div Three</h2>
    <p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Little short strokes. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.

        Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Get tough with it, get strong. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.
        
        Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. You have to make these big decisions. I like to beat the brush. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.
        
        It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.
        
        Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. It all happens automatically. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See there how easy that is.
