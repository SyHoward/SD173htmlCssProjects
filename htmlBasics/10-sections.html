    <h1>Section 1</h1>
    <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
    
    Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Here's another little happy bush
    
    Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Put it in, leave it alone.
